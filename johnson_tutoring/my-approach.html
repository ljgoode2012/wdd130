                    <p>My philosophy in successful tutoring is that as partners, the teacher needs one thing and the student needs one thing. As the teacher, I need an understanding of each individual students current understanding and needs. My students need confidence and the belief that they are capable. It is with these goals in mind that my first tutoring session consists of an assessment.<br><br>
                    Often when we say “assessment” students immediately think “test” since that is often how it is administered at school. Typical assessments or diagnostic tools at schools only report on if a student got an answer right or wrong and the different statistics around that. They do not and cannot report on what strategy the student was using. They do not show whether a wrong answer was given because a student lost confidence and gave up or if a right answer was obtained by pure lucky guess. For that reason, my assessment is not just about right or wrong answers, I have my students sit with me and I observe my students do the assessment. I observe their strategies and their level of confidence. I also go over their assessment with them and explore further what their understanding and skill level is in the work they demonstrated. Perhaps most importantly, I teach my students from the very beginning about the process of building a new skill that every single person goes through in order gain competency in it. I make sure that I teach them, no matter what level they are at, that they are moving through that typical learning process just like everybody else and are in no way “different” or “failing”. I start off with a strategy that builds confidence and gets my students off on the right foot. They learn not only mathematics, but also strategies on how to push through the learning process until skill competency has been reached.</p>

                    <p>Based upon the individualized notes and results of my assessment, and academic standards, I create a plan for each student. I outline which concepts need improvement, which strategies are missing, and provide materials that will best serve my student’s skill level. With my students, I plan milestones and the timeframes for those milestones to be reached. I then track their progress and give regular guidance, feedback, and encouragement to keep them motivated and on track.<br><br>
                        Often times students may need individualized accommodation. Some students may need tutoring over a virtual platform, some need in-person instruction. Some students may need visual or concrete aids. In fact, often times it is creating visuals that allows students to create their own strategies that work for them. As a self-employed, one-on-one tutor I can highly tailor your student’s academic plan to their very detailed needs. I am not restricted by any school’s or company’s limited, predesigned programs and materials.</p>
