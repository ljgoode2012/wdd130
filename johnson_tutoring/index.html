                    <h2>My name is Lauren Johnson</h2>
                    <p>I hold a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Mathematics and before I began my tutoring journey, I tackled teaching mathematics in middle school classrooms. I know from experience the limitations the classroom experience has on adequately preparing students and ensuring everyone is getting the help they need. This is why I enjoy one-on-one tutoring. Now I get to give each student the attention and instruction I wished I could have given when I was teaching an entire class. I also enjoy seeing students grow in their academic skills in a low pressure, low stress environment. Without peers, social pressures, and intimidating authority figures looking over their shoulder, I get to watch my students relax and discover how capable they are in the world of mathematics.</p>
