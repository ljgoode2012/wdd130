    <h2>Lindsey Goode</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Lindsey Goode. My husand and I are from Southern California and 
        we currently live in Ohio with our three children. I am expecting our fourth child 
        in August and we just found out we are having another little boy!</p>

    <p>My husband and I
        love to play DnD (Dungeons and Dragons) with some friends/neighbors. We even plan 
        some adventures for a nieces and nephews at family reunions and its become a fun 
        anticipated tradition. Soon, when our children are a little older we will be able to
        create fun stories with them as well.</p> 
        
    <p>I am taking this course as part of my Applied Technology degree. I hope to begin a 
        career in web and software development.</p>
